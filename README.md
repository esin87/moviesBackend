## Description:

The cinopsis movie web application created by Mindy Marmol, Peter Lutz, Ryan Zimmerman, and Suzann Adams is a place where creative storytellers can post a synopsis or short summary of their film ideas for the public to read and rate. This application is a site where an interested audience and potential screen writers can share and provide feedback in the form of rating the synopsis on a scale of 1 to 10 with the top five highest rated films, per genre, listed on the homepage. The userController component makes it possible for a site visitor to create a username, signup then read or rate movie ideas. The movieController component of this app allows the user to create, read, update and delete a movie that he or she has submitted. The ratingsController component provides the framework for the user to update and delete his rating of a movie.
