## Description:

The Cinopsis movie web application created by Mindy Marmol, Peter Lutz, Ryan Zimmerman, and Suzann Adams is a place where creative storytellers can post a synopsis or short summary of their film idea for the public to read and rate. This application is a site where an interested public audience and potential or current screen writers can share, provide and receive feedback by rating the synopsis of the film on a scale of 1 to 10. The top five highest rated films, per genre, will be listed on the homepage. This site can be the launching pad for writers to eventually write a fully developed movie script that can be proposed to a filmmaker. The userController component makes it possible for a site visitor to create a username, signup then read or rate movie ideas. The movieController component of this app allows the user to create, read, update and delete a movie that he or she has submitted. The ratingsController component provides the framework for the user to update and delete his rating of a movie.

## Technologies Used:

The dependencies installed in this app are: Chai, Mocha, Bcryptjs, Cors, Express, Mongoose, Nodemon and Supertest. Bcryptjs is used for login password authentication.

## Getting Started/Installation:

This application can be used by pulling it up on GitHub, forking it to your personal repository, then cloning and copying it into your terminal. The next step is to run npm install to install the required dependencies, then npm run start on your terminal to run the application in the browser. Then click onto the website and enjoy, otherwise you can also pull it up on Heroku. The link is listed again here: http://cinopsis.herokuapp.com/api/movies/

## Contribution Guidelines:

Contributors can open an issue on this repository at https://github.com/pjl4/moviesBackend if there are suggestions to improve this application.

## Problems & Difficulties:

It took significant effort to get some tests related to user ID and movie ID to pass in the backend.

## Future Additions:

In the future, we would like to add the feature of allowing a place for the user to provide written feedback to the author of the film, as well as, post an image or illustration that reflects the synopsis of their proposed film.
